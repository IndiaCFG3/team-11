		<p><i>Sight and Life is on a quest to end malnutrition.Given the mounting evidence that eggs can improve maternal and child nutrition in developing countries, we are implementing projects and new innovations in egg production, egg-based products, models, tools and approaches to address protein and micronutrient malnutrition during pregnancy, infancy, and adolescence.</i></p>

		<p><i>To support countries and partners working in this area, we have developed the egg hub website - a one-stop shop for information on egg production and consumption in LMICs, including policy publications, research studies and evaluations and success stories from around the world.</i></p>

		<p><i>Egg Hub provides an oppurtunity to everyone to have a clear analysis of the egg supply and demand across the globe. This makes it easier for the stakeholders, poultry industry, investors to do their jobs right.</i></p>
